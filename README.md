This is my first functioning website! I created a Rock Paper Scissors game as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The website is able to calculate wins and losses based on the player's and computer's choice. It is also able to keep and display a score. 

Timeline: 1 day of learning, 1 day of coding. Completed on 4/22/20 CONGRATS!

Extra features that could be added in the future: 
  display the computer's choice,
  highlight image when clicked upon, 
  image or scoreboard to glow depending on win or loss,
  limit to play to 5 rounds

This music video would also be fun to add to the page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZHgTz0u1Ig
